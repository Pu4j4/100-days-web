                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
                    It is used to design web pages using a markup
                    language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext
                    and Markup language. Hypertext defines the
                    link between the web pages. A markup language
                    is used to define the text document within tag
                    which defines the structure of web pages.
                    HTML is a markup language that is used by the
                    browser to manipulate text, images, and other
                    content to display it in the required format.

                    C is a procedural programming language. <br>It
                    was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie
                    as a system programming language to write
                    operating system.<br> The main features of C
                    language include low-level access to memory,
                    simple set of keywords, and clean style,
                    these features make C language suitable for
                    system programming like operating system or
                    compiler development.<br>

                Java has been one of the most popular
                programming language for many years.
                Java is Object Oriented.<br> However it is
                not considered as pure object oriented
                as it provides support for primitive
                data types (like int, char, etc)<br> The
                Java codes are first compiled into byte
                code (machine independent code).<br> Then
                the byte code is run on Java Virtual
                Machine (JVM) regardless of the
                underlying architecture.<br>

            Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. <br>
            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. <br>
            It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).<br>
