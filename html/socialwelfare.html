        <p>
            <ul>
            <li>These are the most complex and controversial of welfare and security programs. Benefits may include indemnification for lost wages in addition to medical treatment.</li><br>
                <li>Coverage ranges from universal down to only those employed by participating employers.<br></li>
                 <li>Financing may be contributory or governmental, depending in particular upon the method of providing service in a given country.</li><br>
                  <li> Medical care may be provided by private practitioners and suppliers or by departments of government organized to provide it; private practitioners may be paid directly by the government or by the patient, who is then reimbursed by the government.</li><br>
                 <li>With varying degrees of public involvement in the actual provision of health care come degrees of choice by the patient, of permanence in patient-physician relations, of incentive to hold down costs, of regularity in physicians' incomes, and of ease of administration.<br>
