        <p>
            <ul>
            social welfare program, any of a variety of governmental programs designed to protect citizens from the economic risks and insecurities of life.<br>
             The most common types of programs provide benefits to the elderly or retired, the sick or invalid, dependent survivors, mothers, the unemployed, the work-injured, and families.<br> 
             Methods of financing and administration and the scope of coverage and benefits vary widely among countries.<br>
A brief treatment of welfare and security programs follows. For full treatment, see social service.<br>

            <ul>
                These are the most complex and controversial of welfare and security programs. Benefits may include indemnification for lost wages in addition to medical treatment.<br>
                 Coverage ranges from universal down to only those employed by participating employers.<br>
                  Financing may be contributory or governmental, depending in particular upon the method of providing service in a given country.<br>
                   Medical care may be provided by private practitioners and suppliers or by departments of government organized to provide it; private practitioners may be paid directly by the government or by the patient, who is then reimbursed by the government.<br>
                   With varying degrees of public involvement in the actual provision of health care come degrees of choice by the patient, of permanence in patient–physician relations, of incentive to hold down costs, of regularity in physicians’ incomes, and of ease of administration.<br>

        <h2>Unemployment benefit programs</h2>

These are common in industrialized countries, less so in developing countries.<br>
 They usually provide 50 to 75 percent of base wages to workers who are normally employed and have become unemployed through no fault of their own and who are willing and able to work.<br>
 Benefits are provided for limited periods and are financed typically from compulsory insurance payments made by employers or employees or both, sometimes supplemented by government funds.<br>
