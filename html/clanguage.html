        <h1 style="color:blue">What is C?</h1>
        <p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.<br>
            It is a very popular language, despite being old.<br>
            C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

        <h1 style="color:lightseagreen">Why Learn C?</h1>
        <p>t is one of the most popular programming language in the world
            If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar.<br>
            C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python.<br>
            C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies.<br>

        <h2>Get Started With C</h2>
        <p>To start using C, you need two things:<br>
            <br>
            A text editor, like Notepad, to write C code.<br>
            A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand.<br>
        
        There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE</p>
