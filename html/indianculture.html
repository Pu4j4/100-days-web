        <!--About our great Indian culture-->
        <p>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artifacts and technologies that originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse India.<br>
             The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. <br>
            India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from place to place within the country.<br>
         </p>
         <h2 style="border:2px solid rgb(255, 0, 242)">Religious culture</h2>
    <p> Indian religions have shaped Indian culture.<br>
        Indian-origin religions Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, are all based on the concepts of dharma and karma.<br>
         Ahimsa, the philosophy of nonviolence, is an important aspect of native Indian faiths whose most well known proponent was Mahatma Gandhi, who used civil disobedience to unite India during the Indian independence movement – this philosophy further inspired Martin Luther King Jr.during the American civil rights movement.<br>
          Foreign-origin religion, including Abrahamic religions, such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam, are also present in India,[8] as well as Zoroastrianism[9][10] and Baháʼí Faith[11][12] both escaping persecution by Islam[13][14][15] have also found shelter in India over the centuries.</p>
