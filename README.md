## 100-days-web
100-days-web is an initiative I am committing to take,where I will be spending each day working on this challenge to improve my skills,bulid strong and consistent coding habits.
####I'm going to follow 3 main rules:
- Code for a minimum of one hour each day for the next 100 days.
- I'll be posting my progress with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.(www.linkedin.com/in/bhanu-bethala)
- I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
