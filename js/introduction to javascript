JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
JavaScript is easy to learn.
The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine(like node.js).
